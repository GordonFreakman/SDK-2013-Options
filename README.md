# SDK-2013-Options

Direct port of the Half-Life 2 styled options menu from GameUI.dll to the client.
Copy the contents of this repo except the "mod" folder to the client folder of your code repo, and then rebuild all of your projects to get this to compile.

On the mod side, copy the contents of the "mod" folder to your mod so it uses my options menu.

## TODO
- Portal support
- Multiplayer support
- Reading from GameInfo.txt
